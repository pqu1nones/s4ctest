                    <p>
                    But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do
                    who have no hope. For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with 
                    him those who have fallen asleep. For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are 
                    left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will descend 
                    from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the 
                    dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds 
                    to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. Therefore encourage one another with these words.

                        <h2>The Origin and Accuracy of "Rapture."</h2>
                        <p>
                        In <b>1 Thessalonians 4:17</b>, the New Testament uses the phrase "caught up," which originates from the Greek word "harpazo." 
                        This term translates to "to seize upon by force" or "to snatch up," conveying a sense of swift and powerful action. The Latin 
                        translators later adopted the word "rapturo," which is how the English word "rapture" came to be derived.
                        <br>
                        <br>                        
                        Despite some claims that "rapture" is not a biblical term, this assertion is misleading. Almost every word in our English Bible 
                        has been translated from Greek or Hebrew, meaning that none of them appear in their original form within the text itself. The 
                        words "God," "Jesus," and even "love" are all examples of this, as they represent translations of original linguistic expressions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In fact, each of these words carries significant meaning and relevance to the biblical narrative. Similarly, the English word 
                        "rapture," which conveys the idea of being swiftly taken up or seized, is a fitting translation for the Greek concept of "harpazo." 
                        By examining the etymology and historical development of this term, we can gain a deeper understanding of its accuracy and utility 
                        in conveying the biblical message.

                        <br>
                        <b>Christ's role: </b>In the Rapture, Christ comes for His own, whereas in the Second Coming, He

                        <p>
                        <b>Greek words: </b>The Rapture is referred to as "apokatathesis" (absence), while the Second Coming is called 
                        "epiphaneia" (appearance).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Church's absence: </b>The church is not present during the Tribulation period, starting from chapter 4 of Revelation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Lawlessness: </b>The absence of the church contributes to the lawlessness described in <b>2 Thessalonians 2:3</b>.

                        <p>
                        <b>The Church as a shell: </b>During the Tribulation, the "church" on earth is actually an apostate shell of nominal 
                        Christianity that has lost its true believers.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Treaty with Israel: </b>The Tribulation involves a treaty between Israel and the Antichrist, which will lead to 
                        the defilement of the Temple (<b>Revelation 13</b>).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Population of the Millennium: </b>Only those who survived the Tribulation period will be allowed to enter the 
                        Millennium, while others will be judged.

                        <h2>What if I missed the Rapture?</h2>
                        <p>
                        If you missed the Rapture, you still have a chance to be saved. However, you will have to endure the Tribulation period,
                        which will be a time of great suffering and persecution. The Bible describes this period as a time of great distress. Jesus
                        said that it will be a time of trouble such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will been
                        (<b>Mathew 24:1</b>).
