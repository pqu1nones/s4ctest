                        Commission of our Lord, Jesus Christ. While targeting a
                        multi-ethnic, multi-cultural people, we desire to effectively
                        minister to a diverse social, economic, and ethnic background of people.
                        We will unite them with Kingdom Love and Purpose by preaching
                        the Gospel of the Kingdom of God and the soon coming of our
                        Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, coupled with the teachings of the "Uncompromised" Word of God.

                        services, crusades, evangelism, multi media ministry, and
                        creative outreaches for children, teens, and young adults.
                        We will endeavor to share our victorious lives in Christ Jesus
                        with an unregenerate and perishing world. Our energies and
                        resources will focus on developing and harvesting a healing oasis,
                        empowering and encourage every believer within our reach,

                        purity and innocence to the depths of sin and iniquity 
                        (wickedness, sinfulness, grossly immoral acts,), and 
                        that in consequence of this, all mankind are sinners
                        sold unto Satan. Sinners, not by constraint but by choice,
                        are shaped in iniquity and utterly void by nature of 
                        that holiness required by the law of God. Positively

                        We are a family on a mission to know, love, and serve Jesus together. 
                        As a church, we value community, connection, and belonging. We believe 
                        that every person has a unique role to play in our collective life, 
                        and we seek to create an environment where everyone can grow, learn, and flourish.

                        We are called to live out the values of the Kingdom of God in all aspects of life. 
                        This means embracing a culture that is marked by humility, compassion, and justice. 
                        We strive to see the world through the lens of Jesus' teachings, and we seek to be 
                        a reflection of His love, mercy, and truth.

                        We believe that the Holy Spirit is our guide, our strength, and our motivation. 
                        We seek to live a life that is surrendered to God's will, guided by the Holy Spirit, 
                        and empowered by faith. We strive to see each other living out their faith in 
                        practical ways, demonstrating the love of Christ to those around us.
